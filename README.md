## Torque 2D -- twistscript branch

This is a fork of Torque2D which replaces the scripting interpreter and associated bindings with a better thought system which fits the following criteria:

* Register based interpreter
* Reference counted values
* Less emphasis on strings, more emphasis on data
* Binding API still works mostly like the old system

Please note that while currently the interpreter will work, there are still a few things which need to be completed so use with caution.
